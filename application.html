    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Dig Dug is a classic arcade game where your goal is to eliminate enemies by either inflating them until they explode or by dropping rocks on them. The game is set in a maze-like underground world, and you must dig tunnels to reach your enemies and avoid getting caught. It's a test of strategy and timing as you navigate through the underground maze.</p>

      <li>Each level has a set of monsters, and you need to clear them to progress to the next level. Watch out for the larger enemies that will require you to inflate them multiple times to defeat.</li>
      <li>If you get caught by a monster, you'll lose a life. Keep an eye on your remaining lives at the bottom left of the screen.
