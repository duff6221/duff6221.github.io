    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Dig Dug is a classic arcade game where your goal is to eliminate enemies by either inflating them until they explode or by dropping rocks on them. The game is set in a maze-like underground world, and you must dig tunnels to reach your enemies and avoid getting caught. It's a test of strategy and timing as you navigate through the underground maze.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To start the game, press <strong>Right Shift</strong> to go to the select screen/insert a quarter.</li>
      <li>Once you've inserted a quarter, press <strong>Enter</strong> to start a one-player game.</li>
      <li>As you play, use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move your character around the screen.</li>
      <li>Press the <strong>S</strong> key to inflate and pop the monsters, turning them into smaller pieces of fruit or other items that you can collect for points.</li>
      <li>Your goal is to defeat the monsters in each level while avoiding getting caught by them. The more monsters you defeat, the higher your score!</li>
      <li>As you inflate monsters, be careful of the other enemies around you. If you're not quick enough, the monsters can still defeat you.</li>
      <li>Each level has a set of monsters, and you need to clear them to progress to the next level. Watch out for the larger enemies that will require you to inflate them multiple times to defeat.</li>
      <li>If you get caught by a monster, you'll lose a life. Keep an eye on your remaining lives at the top of the screen.</li>
      <li>Continue playing until all your lives are lost or you've completed the game! The more levels you progress, the more challenging the game becomes!</li>
